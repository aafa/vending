# What are we doing
[Vending machine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vending_machine) quick implementation

###What should we sell, basic idea?
?

Not gonna focus too much on that first, let's say we're selling candies for CandyCoins  
Later I could easily change that 

###What kind of interaction do we need
- API
  - simple rest
- UI
  - web (scalajs? hmm, interesting)
  - mobile (android on scala? :)
- CLI
  - idk, seems boring
  
  
  ###Let's see pro\cons for this options 
  1. REST API
  ```
  + very familiar, can do quick
  - project needs to be run locally, not cool
  ```
  2. Web on ScalaJs
  ```  
  + can be run from gh-pages
  + sounds like fun
  - first try with scalajs of mine, will take longer, risky  
  ```
  
  Other options not very interesting\more demanding
  
  ### Resolution
  Gonna stick with `ScalaJs`, that would be both more convenient 
  for user to check results and for me to get my hands on ScalaJs
