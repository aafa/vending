# What are we doing
[Vending machine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vending_machine) quick implementation

###What should we sell, basic idea?
?

Not gonna focus too much on that first, let's say we're selling candies for CandyCoins  
Later I could easily change that 

###What kind of interaction do we need
- API
  - simple rest
- UI
  - web (scalajs? hmm, interesting)
  - mobile (android on scala? :)
- CLI
  - idk, seems boring
